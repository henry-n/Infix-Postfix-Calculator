# Infix-Postfix-Calculator
Infix to Postfix Calculator using Stack and Lists in C++

All Copyrights Are Under Me, Huy Nguyen, 

The program allows users to enter an expression in any form such as ( a + b - 100 ).
**Take note that I have left spaces inbetween each input so that the program can tokenize everything correctly**

Users can then enter values to the respected variables.

The program does not currently safeguard against division by 0 and will also break when inputing a negative number in
Infix form like ( -1 + a ), as the token will read the negative sign as a minus operator first and ignore the number after it.

This was made for my Data Structure class. Attached is the pdf of the requirement as well.
**Note that I also didn't separate the functions into an implementation file because the program was to be graded together in one file**
